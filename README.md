### Hi there 👋😊 

I am Vinitsa Gorova, currently, a Compliance Officer at eDynamix. :bowtie:

I am definitely what may be called an Information Security and Cybersecurity enthusiast. 
I ❤ learning! If fact,  :eyes: I love it so much it gets me in trouble with how much things i take up at the same time.  :godmode:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on perfecting my web development knowledge, specifically - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript Basics through SoftUni.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything really - throw me a challenge and i will strive to add value.
- 💬 Ask me about GDPR, consent taking (can go in detail about exact process), ISO/IEC 27001, PCI/DSS, ...etc.
- 📫 How to reach me: 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My upmost favourite videogame is Skyrim.
